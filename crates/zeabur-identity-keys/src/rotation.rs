//! The signing-key schedule.
//!
//! Each algorithm has a [`KeyRing`]. A key moves through three phases that are derived from two
//! timestamps, never stored as mutable state:
//!
//! - **Pending:** published in the JWK set but not yet signing (`now < activates_at`).
//! - **Active:** the newest key with `activates_at <= now`; it signs everything.
//! - **Retired:** a newer key has become active; still published so tokens it signed keep
//!   verifying, until `retain_after` has passed since it stopped signing.
//!
//! Because the active key is derived from the time, a published successor takes over on
//! schedule even if the reconcile loop runs late, and nothing depends on a timer firing on time.
//! A stored phase field would need a write to happen on time and could drift.
//! [`KeyRing::tick`] is a pure function of the ring, the time and the policy (plus a key
//! generator), so the whole schedule is tested without a clock or storage.
//!
//! # Why keys are published ahead
//!
//! Verifiers cache the JWK set. kube-apiserver 1.34 to 1.36 use go-oidc v2, which re-fetches the
//! set on an unknown `kid` only once the cached copy's `Cache-Control` lifetime (plus 30 s) has
//! expired ([kube-apiserver OIDC], [go-oidc v2]). An issuer that signs with a new key the moment
//! it exists, as Dex does ([Dex]), therefore breaks kube-apiserver for up to that lifetime. Zeabur
//! Identity publishes each key [`RotationPolicy::publish_ahead`] (24 h) before it signs, far longer
//! than the JWK set's `max-age` (5 min); the server refuses to start unless `max-age` is shorter.
//! Verifiers that cache the JWK set for longer than the publish-ahead time will fail after a
//! rotation.
//!
//! Retired keys stay published for [`RotationPolicy::retain_after`], as [OIDC Core] §10.1.1
//! recommends ("retain recently decommissioned signing keys for a reasonable period of time"),
//! so every token they signed keeps verifying until it expires.
//!
//! With the default policy the JWK set holds one or two keys per algorithm: the active key, plus
//! either its pending successor (from day 6) or its retired predecessor (for a day after a
//! rotation). A third key appears only if `retain_after` exceeds
//! `rotation_period - publish_ahead`.
//!
//! # Clock errors
//!
//! A clock jumping forward advances the schedule, which is safe because keys are published
//! ahead. A clock jumping backwards can leave no active key; [`KeyRing::tick`] then creates one
//! that is active immediately, which a verifier may not have cached yet. Hosts are expected to run
//! NTP.
